Shannon Diversity of different species in streams

As fine sediment in the streambed increases,
Shannon diversity is decreased. This could be due
to sedimentation reducing hiding spots of species.
Additionally, phosphorus is important for the
primary production of a system, and they are tied
to sediments. They can be lost through erosion,
and more sediment can cause more phosphorus to
become tied with sediment.
